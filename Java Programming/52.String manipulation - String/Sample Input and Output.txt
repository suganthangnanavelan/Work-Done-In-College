String = Object Oriented Programming
String(Lowercase) = object oriented programming
String(Uppercase) = OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
String is empty = false
Length = 27
Substring = Object
Length of substring = 6
String concatenation = Object Oriented Programming in java
First Index of 'e' = 3
Last Index of 'e' = 13
Traversing the String character by character
O b j e c t   O r i e n t e d   P r o g r a m m i n g
Substring equal to 'object' = false
Substring equal to 'object' (Ignore case) = true
String starts with 'java' = false
String starts with 'Obj' = true
String ends with 'ing' = true
Region matching of "Object" with string(0(index),6(noofchars)) = true
Region matching of "program" with string(16(index),23(noofchars)) = false
Region matching of "program" with string(16(index),23(noofchars))-Ignore case) = true
Character at index 16 = P
Replace first 'O' with 'Q' = Qbject Oriented Programming
Replace all 'O' with 'Q' = Qbject Qriented Programming
String spliting (delimiter = ' ')
Object
Oriented
Programming
Joining Strings (delimiter = '_') = Programming_in_java
String = "   Programming in java   "
Triming whitespaces = "Programming in java"
Strip leading whitespaces = "Programming in java   "
Strip trailing whitespaces = "   Programming in java"
Strip leading and trailing whitespaces = "Programming in java"
Coverting 10(int) to String = 10
Coverting 1.234(float) to String = 1.234
Coverting 'x'(char) to String = x
Coverting true(boolean) to String = true
String = hello
String in reverse = olleh
String = racecar
String in reverse = racecar
String = This was converted into a byte[]
String = was converted into a char[] using getChars()
String = This was converted into a char[] using toCharArray()
String value remains unchanged(immutable type) = Object Oriented Programming
