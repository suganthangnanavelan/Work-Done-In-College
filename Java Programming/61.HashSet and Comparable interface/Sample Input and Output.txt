Ascending order of points based on their distance from origin
(0.0,0.0)
(3.0,4.0)
(6.0,8.0)

Distance between all possible pair of points
(3.0,4.0) - (6.0,8.0) = 5.000
(3.0,4.0) - (0.0,0.0) = 5.000
(6.0,8.0) - (3.0,4.0) = 5.000
(6.0,8.0) - (0.0,0.0) = 10.000
(0.0,0.0) - (3.0,4.0) = 5.000
(0.0,0.0) - (6.0,8.0) = 10.000
