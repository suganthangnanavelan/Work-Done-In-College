Apply KNN (with and without PCA) with different K values and analyze accuracy with a line plot.
Attribute Information:

The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes (column 21, fail or succeed) given scaled values of climate model input parameters (columns 3-20).

Column 1: Latin hypercube study ID (study 1 to study 3)

Column 2: simulation ID (run 1 to run 180)

Columns 3-20: values of 18 climate model parameters scaled in the interval [0, 1]

Column 21: simulation outcome (0 = failure, 1 = success)
